# External reconstruction of the 3D velocity (templates) 

External velocity templates are very valuable for high-signal-to-noise detection of the moving lens effect as well as the kinetic SZ. The goal of this pipeline is reconstructing 3D-velocities from halo-catalogues **and** make redshift-binned healpix maps of these. Code will see update ASAP. We get overdensity from halo distributions and at late times and on large scales we relate <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dot{\delta}=-\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}" border="0"/> to get the 3D velocity field. We bin various 1d-projected velocities onto healpix maps to be used in cross-correlation science and forecasts. Code under development.
