# External reconstruction of the 3D velocity (templates) 

External velocity templates are very valuable for high-signal-to-noise detection of the moving lens effect as well as the kinetic SZ. The goal of this pipeline is reconstructing 3D-velocities from halo-catalogues **and** make redshift-binned healpix maps of these. Code will see update ASAP.
